## 1. Community Support

This is a community supported SDK. 

For new and existing users, you can use the current version as it is. The team at Microsoft would no longer be providing official support for those using this SDK. You can continue to get community support and updates at [PlayFab forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html).

We are currently looking for reliable community partners to provide long-term support for this SDK. If you are interested to take ownership and provide future maintenance, let us know. 

What you have to do: 
* Fork this repo
* Push your updates
* Make sure you follow the Apache License, Version 2.0 guidelines for reproduction and modification, and document that Microsoft PlayFab is the original creator
* Go to [PlayFab forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html)
* Write a post with a link to your forked repo so everyone knows about them

We're excited to hear from you. Thank you for your support and happy coding.
