# PythonSdk README

## 1. Community Support

The internal team that owned this SDK will no longer be making additional changes. Any customers that wish to develop with this SDK can use it as-is, but without support. We are seeking community partners who would be willing to take ownership of this SDK and opt-in for ownership and further maintenance. Please fork this repo, visit our forums, and post your intent there, with the new repo location. From there other customers can find that post and find your repo.

Please follow the Apache 2 license guidelines for reproduction and modification, and document that Microsoft PlayFab is the original creator.

Thank you for your support and happy coding.
